Today is my first time working on an HTML project, and I am so excited to start exploring what I've learned during this formation. This project will include every single subject that we have discussed, including lists, text types (bold, emphasis), links, and images. The idea is to create a web page that talks about different recipes. For every recipe, there will be a link that leads to a new web page. Since I am Moroccan, I'll try to share the most popular recipes in my country. They are traditional and healthy, so feel free to check it out!!!!
