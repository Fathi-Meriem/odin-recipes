    <h2> STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pressure cooker, heat three tablespoons of oil.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken cut into pieces, the onions cut into strips, the salt, the ground black pepper, the spices, two bay leaves and the bouquet garni.</li>
            <li>Moisten in 1/2L of water.</li>
            <li>Close the casserole dish and let cook for approximately 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bone the flesh and cut it into strips. Remove the bay leaves and bouquet garni.</li>
            <li>Take half of the sauce into which we pour eight lightly beaten eggs.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat when they are still soft. Fry the blanched almonds in three tablespoons of olive oil, when they are golden, remove them, drain them and leave aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 60°C.</li>
            <li>Butter a shallow round mold, approximately 30 cm in diameter. Line the edges with four overlapping sheets of pastry.</li>
            <li>Arrange the crushed almonds mixed with the granulated sugar, cinnamon, sprinkle with orange blossom water.</li>
            <li>Place half of the eggs cooked in the sauce and the onions on top, sprinkle with the reduced sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover with two buttered pastry sheets.</li>
            <li>Add the crumbled chicken pieces, the rest of the eggs and the remaining sauce.</li>
            <li>Fold over the stuffing the part of the pastry sheets that stick out. Cover with the rest of the leaves, drizzle with melted butter. Bake the Moroccan Bastilla in the oven at 160°C for 25 to 30 min.</li>
            <li>Decorate with icing sugar and cinnamon.</li>
        </ol>
